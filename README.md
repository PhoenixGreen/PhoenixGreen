- 👋 Hi, I’m @PhoenixGreen
- 👀 I’m interested in Decred and the nature of decrentralised cryprocurrencies with a determined coin supply, 21 million being my preffered quantity
- 🌱 Since 2011 I have taught computer science to secondary school students with a focus on Data Representation, Networks, Systems, Python, HTML, CSS. I also have a passion for Video, audio and image editing, 3D design using Blender 3D and game development using the GoDot Engine. In recent times, I have also started learning the Go language so that I can start varifiying Decred's codebase. 
- 💞️ I’m currently a contributer to Decred videos and DecredMagazine.com
- 📫 How to reach me - @decredsociety on twitter
